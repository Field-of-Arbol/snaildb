# üêå snaildb

SnailDB is a lightweight, in-progress C++ project inspired by Python's pandas library and InterSystems Cach√©. The primary goal is to create a simple, fun-to-use database-like functionality for ESP32, although it's still a work in progress.

## Purpose

This project aims to provide a basic database structure for ESP32, making it easy and enjoyable for developers to work with data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler and ESP32 development environment set up.

## Usage

To start using SnailDB, follow these steps:

1. Initialize SnailDB:
```
     #include "snaildb.h"

   SnailDB snailDB;
   ```
2. Add Columns:
```
     snailDB.addStrColProp("Name", 10);
   snailDB.addIntColProp("Age", 3);
```   
3. Add Rows:
```
     std::vector<SnailDataType*> rowData = {
       new StrCol("John"),
       new IntCol(25)
   };

   snailDB.addRow(rowData);
   ```
4. Get Row:
```
     std::string row = snailDB.getRow();
   std::cout << row << std::endl;
   ```
   This will print the current row.

### Important Note

SnailDB is still in development, and its main purpose is for fun and experimentation. It is inspired by pandas and Intersystems Cach√© but is not intended for production use.
